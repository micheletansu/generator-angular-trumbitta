This generator is opinionated. It sums up the current state of my understanding of AngularJS best practices and patterns in an enterprise level project.

These opinions of mine cover various aspects like â€“but not limited to:

* Directory layout
* Naming conventions
* When to use a service or a factory
* The minimum usually required Bower packages
* How to separate a development workflow from a production build
* Unit testing

I like it, It works pretty fine for me. Here's hoping it'll work for
someone else, too.

Also, I'll keep on updating it as long as I keep working with Angular. So, if you feel like contributing or even discussing with me about improvements or why I'm wrong in your opinion, be my guest.

## Prerequisites

In order to use the generated AngularJS application, you'll need Grunt and Bower.

```bash
npm install -g bower grunt-cli
```

## Install

This is a [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) generator, so installing it is a matter of having Yeoman installed:

```bash
npm install -g yo
```

Then install the generator itself:

```bash
npm install -g generator-angular-trumbitta
```

## Use the generator

Again, just like every other Yeoman generator, you use it like this:

```bash
mkdir <yourappname> && cd <yourappname>
yo angular-trumbitta
```

You'll be asked some questions:

1. A name for your app (all lowercase, no spaces, no special characters)  
Examples:  
**[OK]** robotcrasher  
**[KO]** suPer Awesome Robot-Crasher!
2. A description (try to be meaningful, while using less than 10-15 words)  
Examples:  
**[OK]** A robot crashing app with Spaceship integrations  
**[OK]** A robot crashing app  
**[KO]** app
3. Your full name (e.g. John Smith)
4. Your email address

The generator will then proceed to run `npm install` and `bower install` for you. If either command fails, just try running it by yourself.

This step could take a while, depending on your connection speed, because involves downloading a couple heavyweight packages. Notable *offenders* are PhantomJS and Bootstrap.

The good news is that you're going to need this done the first time only.

When it's done, launch your newly created angular application to make sure everything worked out as expected:

```bash
grunt serve
```

Then point your browser at `http://localhost:9100` just to be greeted by the underwhelming *Hello world* default page.

Hit `CTRL C` if you want to stop it.

## Use the generated application

### Development

#### Naming conventions

### Testing

### Production

### Grunt tasks

### Configuration

## Compatible packages

## Known issues

Until issue #12 gets fixed, you'll have to edit the `bower.json` of the generated app and change the version for the Bootstrap component from:

```
"bootstrap": "^3.3.4",
```

to:

```
"bootstrap": "3.3.4",
```
